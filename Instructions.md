# Activity 1
## Introduction
Imagine you’re a front-end developer hired to create a modern portfolio website for Alex Styles, a graphic designer looking to showcase their creative projects. Alex wants a clean, professional design that reflects their branding and appeals to potential clients. The website should include sections like About Me, Portfolio, and Contact, with engaging typography, a cohesive color scheme, and subtle animations to draw attention to key elements.

In this activity, you’ll use Microsoft Copilot to write and enhance the CSS for Alex Styles’ portfolio site. This includes implementing responsive typography, designing layouts, and applying advanced styling techniques like transitions and animations.

This is the first of three activities in the project. The CSS you create here will form the foundation for responsive design and UI/UX enhancements in subsequent activities.

## Instructions
### Step 1: Set up the project environment
To begin, you’ll need to get everything ready in your IDE.
- Enable Microsoft Copilot in your IDE to assist with the coding process.
- Create a basic HTML structure for Alex Styles’ portfolio site. Include placeholders for these sections:
    - About Me: A brief introduction to Alex’s background and skills.
    - Portfolio: A grid of project thumbnails, each linking to detailed descriptions.
    - Contact: A simple form for potential clients to reach out.

### Step 2: Write and enhance CSS with Copilot
Use Copilot to generate CSS code for:
- Typography: Define font families, sizes, and scaling that reflect Alex’s brand identity.
- Color scheme: Establish a palette using Alex’s preferred colors for a cohesive look.
- Layout: Apply grid or Flexbox to structure the site’s sections.

### Step 3: Apply advanced CSS techniques
Use Copilot’s suggestions to implement:
- Hover transitions for interactive elements like buttons and links.
- Simple animations to highlight key areas, such as fading in the project thumbnails in the Portfolio section.

### Step 4: Optimize the CSS for performance
Use Copilot to:
- Identify and remove redundant or inefficient styles.
- Ensure the CSS file is well-organized and optimized for fast loading.

### Step 5: Save your work
By the end of this activity, you will have:
- A functional and visually appealing CSS framework for Alex Styles’ portfolio site.
- Optimized and structured CSS, ready for responsive enhancements in the next activity.

Save the HTML and CSS files in your project directory. This code will serve as the foundation for Activity 2, where you will focus on responsive design.

# Activity 2

## Introduction
Alex Styles’ portfolio website is coming together, but it currently looks great only on desktop screens. To impress potential clients who view the site on tablets or mobile devices, it needs to be fully responsive. As a developer, your task is to ensure the site’s layout, typography, and visuals adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

In this activity, you’ll use Microsoft Copilot to generate and implement responsive design suggestions. By adding media queries and flexible layouts, you’ll ensure the site provides a consistent and professional experience on any device.

This is the second of three activities in this project. The responsive design work here will prepare the site for the final phase of UI/UX enhancements.

## Instructions
### Step 1: Review the recap
In Activity 1, you wrote and optimized CSS for Alex Styles’ portfolio site. This included implementing typography, color schemes, and basic layout designs. Now, your focus shifts to making the site responsive, ensuring it looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Step 2: Generate media queries with Copilot
Use Copilot to write media queries for the following breakpoints:
- Mobile devices (max-width: 768px)
- Tablets (max-width: 1024px)
- Desktop screens (min-width: 1025px)

Customize the styles for each breakpoint to adapt the site’s layout and typography.

### Step 3: Implement flexible layouts
Modify the layout for responsiveness using:
- Flexible grid systems to restructure the Portfolio section.
- Flexbox to align elements dynamically based on screen size.

Use Copilot’s suggestions to enhance the adaptability of these layouts.

### Step 4: Enhance responsiveness in the existing project
Incorporate the responsive styles into the CSS created in Activity 1:
- Adjust font sizes for better readability on smaller screens.
- Reorganize the Contact form to fit mobile layouts.

### Step 5:  Test the responsive design
Use browser developer tools to:
- Simulate different screen sizes and verify that the design adapts appropriately.

Identify and fix any issues with Copilot’s assistance.

### Step 6: Save your work
By the end of this activity, you will have:

- A fully responsive portfolio website that adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- CSS code enhanced with media queries and flexible layouts, generated with Copilot.

Save the updated CSS and HTML files. These changes will be further enhanced with UI/UX improvements in Activity 3.

# Activity 3

## Introduction
Alex Styles’ portfolio website is now responsive, but it still lacks the interactive and polished touches that will make it truly stand out to potential clients. Your final task is to enhance the UI/UX by adding engaging interactive elements, refining the design aesthetics, and ensuring a consistent, user-friendly experience.

In this activity, you’ll use Microsoft Copilot to implement features like hover effects, modals, and tooltips, as well as refine the typography, color scheme, and layout for maximum visual appeal. 

This is the final activity in this project, bringing together all your work from Activities 1 and 2.

## Instructions
### Step 1: Review the recap
In Activity 1, you wrote and optimized CSS for Alex Styles’ portfolio site, laying the groundwork for its visual design.

In Activity 2, you made the site fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on various devices.

Now, your focus is on adding interactivity and refining the design for a professional and engaging user experience.

### Step 2: Add interactive elements with Copilot
Use Copilot to generate code for:
- Buttons with hover effects to provide visual feedback.
- A modal for viewing detailed project descriptions in the Portfolio section.
- ooltips for navigation links to improve usability.

### Step 3: Apply visual enhancements
Refine the site’s appearance using Copilot’s suggestions:
- Improve typography for readability and emphasis on key sections.
- Adjust the color scheme for better visual hierarchy and branding alignment.
- Optimize the layout to ensure consistency across the site.

### Step 4: Integrate enhancements into the existing project
Combine the interactive features and design refinements with the responsive design from Activity 2:
- Ensure all elements work harmoniously across different screen sizes.
- Test transitions and animations for smooth functionality.

### Step 5:  Test the responsive design
Use browser developer tools to:
- Simulate different screen sizes and verify that the design adapts appropriately.

Identify and fix any issues with Copilot’s assistance.
### Step 6: Save your work
By the end of this activity, you will have:
- A fully interactive, visually appealing, and user-friendly portfolio website for Alex Styles.
- A completed project that demonstrates your proficiency in front-end design and the use of AI tools like Microsoft Copilot.

Save the final version of Alex Styles’ portfolio site in your project directory. Prepare a brief summary of how Copilot assisted you in implementing these enhancements. This will help you reflect on the value of AI tools in web development. Coming up, you’ll submit this project for feedback and review.
